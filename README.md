## Description

A small, light-weight note taking application that is able to save the notes taken to a database to viewed elsewhere!

Two of my driving reasons behind this project is to deepen my express knowledge with routes and create a small API with json, and my second is to create my first 'full-stack' application. The ability to host on heroku allows for the application to work across different browsers as long as you have the link to access the live server and it's database.

I learnt more about how to create routes with express, what infomation is sent when requests to websites are made and how we can manipulate that, an example is my 404 page, which uses a wildcard to re-direct anyone to who happens to enter an incorrect route.
